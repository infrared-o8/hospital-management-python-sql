## Adding MySQL to PATH Variables

To add MySQL to your PATH variables, follow these steps:

1. **Locate MySQL Path**:  
   Find the path to `mysql.exe` on your machine. It is usually located in:  
   `"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server x.x\bin\mysql.exe"`  
   where `x.x` represents your MySQL server version.

2. **Open Environment Variables**:  
   - Go to **Settings**.
   - Search for **Edit environment variables for your account**.
   - Open the **Environment Variables** window.

3. **Edit PATH Variable**:
   - In the **System Variables** section, find and select the `Path` variable.
   - Click on **Edit** and add the path to `mysql.exe` (e.g., `"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server x.x\bin\"`).
   - **Apply** the changes and close the dialog.
