## Brief Summary
This project was made for the CBSE computer science practicals 2024-25, using SQL and Python. This project intends to allow quicker and easier handling of data relevant to the hospital environment, such as doctors' data, patients' data, and medication data. It also attempts to implement an appointment-scheduling system. 

## Quick Configuration

Run the `init.bat` file to install all dependencies and run main.py. I personally prefer logging in as an admin first, to view all the tables in the database. 

No doctor/patient accounts will be imported with the setting up of the database, so you will have to create a new Doctor or Patient account. As for admin:

AdminID: ADM1
Password: admin
